							To redeem your medal, you have to connect your ethereum compatible
							wallet (only Metamask is supported) to buy/mint it. The price
							depends on the partner organization, and are to be paid in ethers
							(ETH). Note that like all NFT on the ethereum blockchain, you will
							have to pay a fee to the network for your mint to proceed.

							Just like a regular medal, your NFT medal is the everlasting proof
							of your performance. Collect and store it in your wallet, display
							it on NFT compatible social media (twitter for instance).

							medals in your Trophy Cabinet.
